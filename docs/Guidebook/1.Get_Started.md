# 1. Get Started

## 1.1 Install & Import

**Install**

This project had been uploaded to Pypi registry so you can directly download it:

```shell
pip install yuheng
```

Or you can download from some mirror of Pypi if you found it hard to connect to Internet, such as TUNA in China:

```shell
pip install yuheng -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

If you are using Windows and Python version is 3.10 or below, and running a proxy or VPN (such as clash), you need to configure a proxy host to avoid SSL crash.

```shell
pip install yuheng --proxy http://localhost:7890
```

Besides, if you don't trust online service at all, you also can Install by git clone.

**Import**

When you want to do anything with Yuheng

So import this before do anything:

```python
import yuheng
```

## 1.2 Read file

Yuheng offer you different kind of file IO stream, such as file/memory text/network as input stream.

Also it will bring more output stream other than save file. (Maybe network API upload?)

But now, let's started with reading exist local file.

At first we should created a object for Carto class:

```python
world = yuheng.Carto()
world.read_file("YOUR_OSM_FILE")
```

Then waiting for some time, this will differ from file size.
