# 2. Traverse Data

## 2.1 List elements

In Carto class, there are 3 different dict store elements in corresponding type.

Here are implementation in `carto.py`:

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.node_dict: Dict[int, Node] = {}
        self.way_dict: Dict[int, Way] = {}
        self.relation_dict: Dict[int, Relation] = {}
```

The key of dict is individual's `id` and value is that element object. If you want to traverse all element manually you'll need a "for" structure.

Here are example code:

```python
for id in map.way_dict:
    element=id
```

We recommend use object as iterator, not `range()` or `len(dict())` because that isn't such Pythonic, and `id` in OSM data is meaningful.

## 2.2 Read tag in specific elements

Now we assume that you've obtained an object named `element`, and you need read its tags.

Here are implementation in `model_basic.py`:

```python
class BaseOsmModel:
    def __init__(self, attrib: Dict[str, str], tag_dict: Dict[str, str]):
        self.tags: Dict[str, str] = dict(tag_dict)
        self.__tags_backup: Dict[str, str] = dict(tag_dict)
```

NOTE: You shouldn't access `__tags_backup` because this only used for diff purpose.

Tags' key and value are both `str` type, and if you want to traverse a element's all tags, here is a example:

```python
for key in element.tags:
    value=element.tags[key]
```

## 2.3 Practical example

### Usage

If you only need judge whether a element have a key:

```python
if "keyname" in element.tags:
foo()
```

or:

```python
for key in element.tags:
    if key=="keyname":
        foo()
    else:
        pass
```

but I suggest this way because if you need judge whether have not only 1 specific key.

### Combined Usage

If we want to combine all the methods introduced above, starting from `read()` to get the specific value:

```python
for id in map.node_dict:
    for key in map.node_dict[id].tags:
        if key=="yourkey":
            print("yourkey=",map.node_dict[id].tags[key])
```

### Demonstrate in real project

Find Nodes with `name` but no `name:zh` and set `name:zh` inherite the same value as `name`.

```python
import yuheng

# 从.osm文件加载Carto对象
# Read Carto Object from .osm file
carto = yuheng.Carto()
carto.read_file("map.osm")

# 遍历所有点
# Iterate over all Nodes
for node in carto.node_dict.values():
    # 跳过无name或有name:zh标签的点
    # Skip Nodes not tagged name or name:zh
    if "name" not in node.tags or "name:zh" in node.tags:
        continue

    # 获取name，并设置name:zh
    # Get name, and set name:zh
    name = node.tags["name"]
    node.tags["name:zh"] = name

    # 如果修改前后的标签有差异，则打印差异
    # Print difference if tags changed
    if node.has_tag_diff():
        node.print_diff()

# 写到.osm文件
# Write to .osm file
carto.write("map_changed.osm")
```
