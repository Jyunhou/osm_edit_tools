# OverpassQL

This folder store every QL we used in Yuheng's testing.

Test are extracted from official documents: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_API_by_Example#Server_Status_Queries

They are only mentioned in wiki and haven't release a code repository. So we won't directly copy them in Yuheng's code repository because of license conflict.

For featured overpassql you can see:
